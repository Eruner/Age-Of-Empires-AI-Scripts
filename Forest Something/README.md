# Forest Something
As an inspiration of [Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTRwNlRaw9Y) [Nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFDDZAsXGQ) videos where whole map is just a forest and players have to cut their way through and manage their space, so I've decided to make an AI that would be able to play such map. After couple of tests I've found that AI is not willing to build Mill close to town center, so it greatly delays game progression.  

## How to make this map type
`Forest Something` map is an alternative to the `Forest Nothing` map. To create the Forest Something map, just generate any random map and remove everything except trees, town centers, villagers and scouts. Yes, not other resources, no gold, no food, not even wolfs nor relics.  

## Featured Bots:
* Forest_Something_Celt - first version aimed for Celts civilization

### Celtic first version
This bot is able to advance ages, makes an army of halberds and couple of siege rams and sends one group of army to attack. It can do well in tiny/small maps against Standard AI's that struggle with this type of map, so you can be sure that it will force slow AI's to abdicate. On the other side, it can be defeated by hardest Standard AI and/or by players without much trouble
